# HDT (kinda everything) Display Plugin

Enhance your Hearthstone Battlegrounds streaming experience with the HDT (kinda everything) Display Plugin. This tool overlays information about "anomalies", "buddies", "trinkets", "quests" and "quest rewards" directly onto your stream, saving you from the hassle of manual updates. It's designed to integrate smoothly with Hearthstone Deck Tracker (HDT), providing both streamers and their audience with real-time game insights.

## Features

- **Seamless Overlay Integration**: The information is displayed directly in the Hearthstone Deck Tracker overlay, ensuring a clean and unobtrusive addition to your stream.
- **Move Card**: Reposition the tooltip on the overlay to suit your stream's design.
- **Resize Card**: Resizable tooltips to accommodate different screen sizes and resolutions.
- **Localization**: Display the card in your own language using HDT settings (Options > Tracker > General > Card language).
- **Plug-and-Play**: With its user-friendly setup, all you have to do is enable the plugin and you're good to goâ€”no complicated configurations needed.

## Usage

To install the HDT Display Plugin:

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/WittR/HDTEverythingDisplay/releases/tag/Latest) `.dll` file.
2. Drag and drop the file onto the HDT plugins settings window, or manually extract the `.dll` file to your HDT plugin folder (typically located at `%AppData%\HearthstoneDeckTracker\Plugins`).

Once installed, the plugin will automatically display things tooltips within the Hearthstone Deck Tracker overlay during your game sessions.

## Project Evolution

Originally, this project was designed solely to display **trinkets**.  
Over time, it has expanded to include **anomalies, buddies, quests,** and **quest rewards**, making it an all-in-one tool.
